**GoLocal** is a hyperlocal marketplace application designed to empower local retailers and provide customers with the convenience of online shopping from their trusted nearby stores. By digitizing the inventory of kirana stores, grocery shops, and local vendors, we aim to sustain local economies and reduce the reliance on big-box retail.
